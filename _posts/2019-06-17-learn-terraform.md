Finished the [TerraFrom learning path for Azure](https://learn.hashicorp.com/terraform/?track=azure#azure) and I am impressed. The code is much easier to write than ARM templates and much more readable. Now time to start making my own Terraform configuration files and test them in a DevOps pipeline.
